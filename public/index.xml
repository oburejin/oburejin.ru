      <description>I moved! Finally, transition has been completed and I started to build my own theme.
My goal is to build as small as possible bundle without JS at all, althought I think about couple of nice features I can use JS, the goal is set to go without it.
Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t really understand HUGO theming, I got it working.

      <description>Trying to move hosting to a Netlify. Process was quite fast, actually, but now for some reason I can&amp;rsquo;t build it. Github gives me an error that it can&amp;rsquo;t build, thought I thought that Netlify should give me it.
So, it is a bit weird theme, because if post have not enought text it will not show any text on a main page. What? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s time to create my own theme anyway, I already spent 40 minutes finding whats wrong with my setup thinking I broke something.</description>

      <description>Gerrit. Oh how I don&amp;rsquo;t understand it. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m ok with it and sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m lost with &amp;lsquo;why anyone using it in 2019&amp;rsquo;.
It sits atop GIT, doing same thing but a differently, you need to --amend all the time, you need to &amp;ldquo;Hey please don&amp;rsquo;t forget to git review -d 123456, because I just updated a commit&amp;rdquo; if more than one person working on a commit. An if you do have branches, because you may want to publish things for demos or staging, you git push -f.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Max This is my journey into the HUGO websites creation. There are many like it but this one is mine. I&amp;rsquo;ll share my experience and feelings about this. We&amp;rsquo;ll see where it&amp;rsquo;ll take me and what this site will be about. But for now it&amp;rsquo;ll be about my journey.
Nice to see you here, although I can&amp;rsquo;t really see anybody as here is no trackers or ads, if you want to say hi â€” I&amp;rsquo;m on twitter @oburejin</description>
