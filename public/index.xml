      <description>Moving to Netlify Trying to move hosting to a Netlify. Process was quite fast, actually, but now for some reason I can&amp;rsquo;t build it. Github gives me an error that it can&amp;rsquo;t build, thought I thought that Netlify should give me it.</description>

      <description>Gerrit. Oh how I don&amp;rsquo;t understand it. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m ok with it and sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m lost with &amp;lsquo;why anyone using it in 2019&amp;rsquo;.
It sits atop GIT, doing same thing but a differently, you need to --amend all the time, you need to &amp;ldquo;Hey please don&amp;rsquo;t forget to git review -d 123456, because I just updated a commit&amp;rdquo; if more than one person working on a commit. An if you do have branches, because you may want to publish things for demos or staging, you git push -f.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Max This is my journey into the HUGO websites creation. There are many like it but this one is mine. I&amp;rsquo;ll share my experience and feelings about this. We&amp;rsquo;ll see where it&amp;rsquo;ll take me and what this site will be about. But for now it&amp;rsquo;ll be about my journey.
Nice to see you here, although I can&amp;rsquo;t really see anybody as here is no trackers or ads, if you want to say hi â€” I&amp;rsquo;m on twitter @oburejin</description>
