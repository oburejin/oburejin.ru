Trying to move hosting to a Netlify. Process was quite fast, actually, but now for some reason I can't build it. Github gives me an error that it can't build, thought I thought that Netlify should give me it.

So, it is a bit weird theme, because if post have not enought text it will not show any text on a main page. What?
Well, it's time to create my own theme anyway, I already spent 40 minutes finding whats wrong with my setup thinking I broke something.

So, let's go!
