# Gerrit.

Oh how I don't understand it. Sometimes I'm ok with it and sometimes I'm lost with 'why anyone using it in 2019'. 

It sits atop GIT, doing same thing but a differently, you need to `--amend` all the time, you need to "Hey please don't forget to `git review -d 123456`, because I just updated a commit" if more than one person working on a commit. An if you do have branches, because you may want to publish things for demos or staging, you `git push -f`.

All of this probably made sense before, but now with all the githubs/gitlabs I don't know why anyone will choose it over a modern tools.

Too bad transitioning will be expensive and pointless.

Thank you for your time.
