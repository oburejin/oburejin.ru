# Hi, my name is Max


This is my journey into the HUGO websites creation. There are many like it but this one is mine.
I'll share my experience and feelings about this. We'll see where it'll take me and what this site will be about. But for now it'll be about my journey.

Nice to see you here, although I can't really see anybody as here is no trackers or ads, if you want to say hi â€” I'm on twitter @oburejin

Firstly I want to see how HUGO works and then I want to create my own theme. This'll be a living site and sometimes things will be broken and sometimes will be broken a lot.

This is all I have to say for now. End of transmission.
